# Module5
 In this first practical application assignment of the program, we were asked to seek an answer to the question, “Will a customer accept the coupon?” based on the coupons.csv dataset.

This is a brief nontechnical report highlighting the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.

56.84% of customers accepted the coupon.
43.16% of customers rejected the coupon.

Missing data: With approximately 99% of the values for 'car' being blank it isn't really adding much value to the dataset.Hence dropped the car column.

Bar Coupon findings:
1. Percentage of Bar coupons acceptance is: 41.00%
2. Acceptance Rate for drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 is: 69.52%
3. Acceptance Rate for drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and no kid passengers, occupation is not farming, fishing, forestry is: 71.32%
4. Acceptance rate for Drivers going to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed is: 71.32%
5. Acceptance rate for Drivers going to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 is: 72.17%

Bar Coupon Interpretation:-
Drivers who go to the bar more than once a month and are over 21 are more likely to accept the Bar coupons.
Age Factor: Younger drivers, particularly those under the age of 30, show higher acceptance rate for Bar coupons.                                                   
Marital Status and Occupation: Drivers who are not widowed and have occupations outside of farming, fishing, or forestry are more likely to accept Bar coupons.
My hypothesize suggest that factors like age and marital status, frequency of bar visits, economic status, and dining habits play critical roles in determining the likelihood of accepting Bar coupons.

Coffee Coupon findings:
1. Percentage of Coffee coupons accepted is: 49.92%
2. Yound drivers below the age of 21 accepted Coffee coupons by: 70%
3. Coffee coupon accepted by time 10am is the highest which is: 65%
4. Mostly high school students or high school graduates accepted Coffee coupons by: 55%

Coffee Coupon Interpretation:-
It is interesting to notice the young drivers with age below 21 has higher acceptance rate for Coffee coupons, whereas elderly population with 50 plus shows slightly less acceptance but all other intermediate groups show around 50% acceptance.

Carry Out Coupon and Take Away coupons findings:
1. Baesd on Marital status, Divorced and Widowed drivers accepted Carry Out Coupon and Take Away coupon mostly.
2. Drivers below 21 accepted most of the Carry Out Coupon and Take Away coupon whereas drivers above the age of 21 declined them mostly.
