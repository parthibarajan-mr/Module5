# Module5
 In this first practical application assignment of the program, we were asked to seek an answer to the question, “Will a customer accept the coupon?” based on the coupons.csv dataset.
 This is a brief nontechnical report highlighting the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.

56.84% of customers accepted the coupon.
43.16% of customers rejected the coupon.

Missing data: With approximately 99% of the values for 'car' being blank it isn't really adding much value to the dataset. 

The proportion of total observations that accepted the coupon is approximately 56.84%

Drivers who go to the bar more than once a month and are over 21 are more likely to accept the bar coupon.

It is interesting to notice the young drivers with age below 21 has higher acceptance for coffee coupons, whereas elderly population with 50 plus shows slightly less acceptance but all other intermediate groups show around 50% acceptance.
